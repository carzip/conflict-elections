# About this project

This project is a spin-off of a co-authored publication with [Dennis Hammerschmidt](https://github.com/dennis-hammerschmidt) that [analyzes patterns of violence during conflict elections in Afghanistan](https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=775100) in 2005.

While the geo-spatially disaggregated data for the original publication is based on [UCDP data](https://ucdp.uu.se), this ShinyApp is based on [ACLED data](https://acleddata.com/#/dashboard) and shows how violence that includes the Taliban develops starting 180 days up to the election in 2019.
